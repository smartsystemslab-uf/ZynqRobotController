2. REPORT DETAILS

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell PWM/Writer/clock_counter0_inferred__0/i_, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) PWM/Writer/clock_counter_reg[0]/CLR, PWM/Writer/clock_counter_reg[1]/CLR, PWM/Writer/clock_counter_reg[2]/CLR, PWM/Writer/clock_counter_reg[3]/CLR, PWM/Writer/clock_counter_reg[4]/CLR, PWM/Writer/clock_counter_reg[5]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell PWM/Writer/period_counter[0]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) PWM/Writer/period_counter_reg[0]/CLR, PWM/Writer/period_counter_reg[10]/CLR, PWM/Writer/period_counter_reg[11]/CLR, PWM/Writer/period_counter_reg[12]/CLR, PWM/Writer/period_counter_reg[13]/CLR, PWM/Writer/period_counter_reg[14]/CLR, PWM/Writer/period_counter_reg[15]/CLR, PWM/Writer/period_counter_reg[16]/CLR, PWM/Writer/period_counter_reg[17]/CLR, PWM/Writer/period_counter_reg[18]/CLR, PWM/Writer/period_counter_reg[19]/CLR, PWM/Writer/period_counter_reg[1]/CLR, PWM/Writer/period_counter_reg[20]/CLR, PWM/Writer/period_counter_reg[21]/CLR, PWM/Writer/period_counter_reg[22]/CLR (the first 15 of 32 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.029 ns between PWM/Reader/channel_5_dutycycle_counter_reg[3]/C (clocked by clk_out1_System_clk_wiz_0_0) and PWM/Reader/channel_5_dutycycle_o_reg[4]/D (clocked by clk_out1_System_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.123 ns between PWM/Reader/channel_2_dutycycle_counter_reg[4]/C (clocked by clk_out1_System_clk_wiz_0_0) and PWM/Reader/channel_2_dutycycle_o_reg[4]/D (clocked by clk_out1_System_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
